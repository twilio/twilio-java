## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please use the process described in our [Responsible Disclosure page](https://www.twilio.com/docs/security) rather than opening a public issue.

All security reports will be reviewed and responded to promptly by the Twilio Security Team.

### What happens after you submit a report?

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 1 business day
2. We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
3. We will work with you to verify and reproduce the issue
4. We will develop and test a fix
5. We will coordinate disclosure timing with you

Thank you for helping keep Twilio and our community secure!
